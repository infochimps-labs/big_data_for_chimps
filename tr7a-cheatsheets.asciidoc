[options="header"]
|=======
| character			| meaning
|				|
| TODO				|
|				|
| `.`				| any character
| `\w`				| any word character: a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or `_` underscore. Use `[:word:]` to match extended alphanumeric characters (accented characters and so forth)
| `\s`				| any whitespace, whether space, tab (`\t`), newline (`\n`) or carriage return (`\r`).
| `\d`				| 
| `\x42` (or any number)	| the character with that hexadecimal encoding. 
| `\b`				| word boundary (zero-width)
| `^`				| start of line; use `\\A` for start of string (disregarding newlines). (zero-width)
| `$`				| end of line; use `\\z` for end of string (disregarding newlines). (zero-width)
| `[^a-mA-M]`			| match character in set
| `[a-mA-M]`			| reject characters in set
| `a\|b\|c`			| a or b or c
| `(...)`			| group
| `(?:...)`			| non-capturing group
| `(?<varname>...)`		| named group
|				|
| `*`, `+`			| zero or more, one or more. greedy (captures the longest possible match)
| `*?`, `+?`			| non-greedy zero-or-more, non-greedy one-or-more
| `{n,m}`			| repeats `n` or more, but `m` or fewer times
|				|
|=======

These <<regexp_examples>> are for practical extraction, not validation -- they may let nitpicks through that oughtn't (eg, a time zone of `-0000` is illegal by the spec, but will pass the date regexp given below). As always, modify them in your actual code to be as brittle (restrictive) as reasonable.

.Example Regular Expressions
[options="header"]
|=======
| intent			| Regular Expression    				| Comment
| Double-quoted string		| `%r{"((?:\\.|[^\"])*)"}`  		        	| all backslash-escaped character, or non-quotes, up to first quote
| Decimal number with sign	| `%r{([\-\+\d]+\.\d+)}`                            	| optional sign; digits-dot-digits
| Floating-point number 	| `%r{([\+\-]?\d+\.\d+(?:[eE][\+\-]?\d+)?)}`       	| optional sign; digits-dot-digits; optional exponent
| ISO date               	| `%r{\b(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)T(\d\d):(\d\d):(\d\d)([\+\-]\d\d:?\d\d|[\+\-]\d\d|Z)\b}`	| groups give year, month, day, hour, minute, second and time zone respectively.
