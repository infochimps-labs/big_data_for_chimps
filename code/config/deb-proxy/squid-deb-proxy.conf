#       http://www.squid-cache.org/ and in the FAQ

# settings that you may want to customize

# this file contains private networks (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12,
# 192.168.0.0/16) by default, you can add/remove additional allowed
# source networks in it to customize it for your setup
acl allowed_networks src "/etc/squid-deb-proxy/autogenerated/allowed-networks-src.acl"

# this file contains the archive mirrors by default,
# if you use a different mirror, add it there
